          Since this is my first post, I figured I'd spend a little bit talking about myself!  
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          First of all, I consider myself to be a true "fullstack" developer.  I choose this arbitary title not because I'm trying to talk myself up; rather, I work with technologies that encompass the full application stack (hence, fullstack).   I think it's important to be descriptive of the kinds of tools and technologies we use because otherwise it can be difficult to explain to others what we're good at.

          At my jobs, I’ve been directly involved in all aspects of the software development process, from design to implementation to maintenance and improvement.  I’ve written applications in Node, Python, Java, PHP, and .NET.  Although I don’t depend on frameworks, I find that they do help with communication between developers, which in turn leads to more readable and maintainable code.  I’ve used multiple frameworks in production, including but not limited to Angular, Yii, Flask, and Spring.  As for databases, I’ve used relational (MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server), document-oriented (MongoDB), and object-relational (PostgreSQL).  I have experience optimizing queries for performance.  Usually my job involves wiring a database, an applicaiton sever, and a front end framework together to make something that's actually useful.

          In the end, I created this blog to organize my thoughts and ultimately provide help to others if I can.
